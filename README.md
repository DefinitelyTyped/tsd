TSD - A TypeScript definition package manager
=============================================

TSD is a TypeScript definition file package manager.  let you easily download and install definition files to use in TypeScript projects.

### How to install

TSD is installed using [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/). To install TSD use:

    npm install tsd -g

### Usage

> Your best friend at this stage is probably `tsd -h`.

To view all repository files use:

    tsd all

This will print all file definitions available on repository. To install some file on local project you must use `install` command followed by a lib name:

    tsd install node

This will create by default a folder named `d.ts` (if it doesn't exists) and will download the file definition to this folder.

### TSD configuration

You can define your own custom folder to store definition files with the command:

	tsd ncfg

This will create a file named `tsd-config.json` on current folder with the following content:

	{
		"localPath": "d.ts",
		"repositoryType": "1",
		"uri": "https://github.com/Diullei/tsd/raw/master/deploy/repository.json"
	}	

* **localPath** - Must be the path to your local folder to store definition files. This folder will be created in the first time if not exists.
* **repositoryType** - this property is used to define if uri is a local folder or a url. Use `0` to local folder or `1` to url.
* **uri** - Define if the repository file is an url or a local folder.

### Installing dependencies

Some definition files have dependencies of another files like `socket.io` that depends of `node`. To install dependencies you can use `tsd install` command followed by a list of libs to install. 

Example:

	tsd install socket.io node express
	
This will install _express_, _socket.io_ and _node_ definitions.

### Install dependencies automatically

You can use `install*` command to allow TSD tool to automatically map and install all necessary dependencies. If you use `install* sochet.io` this will install `sochet.io` and `node` because `sochet.io` has `node` mapped as a dependency. If you use the command:

	tsd install* knockback
	
TSD will install `knockback`, `knockout` and `backbone` definition.

### Checking for updates

You can always use `tsd update` command to verify if your local libs are updated.

### Repository

To make a search for any file you must use `search` command.

Example:

    tsd search backbone

TSD get the file definitions from [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped) project. You can view the repository references inside [repository.json](https://github.com/Diullei/tsd/blob/master/deploy/repository.json) file (I'm working to add some anothers). If you want to contribute please make a fork from tsd repo, change the repository.json and make a pull request.
